# 4 Pillars of OOP

## Encapsulation:  
To contain object information in a way that provides a minimal public interface.
## Abstraction:  
A simple model of entities that contains only important properties from the perspective of an application.
## Inheritance:  
Reusing the property and method of a parent class on a child class.
## Polymorphism:  
Meaning "many forms" it is used in coding through overriding and overloading.  
Overriding is using the same method name from a parent class in a child class in order to customize it's state.  
Overloading is when you have two or more methods in the same class with the same name, but feed them different information or arguments.
